### Rai's Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was last updated on 1:28 AM Saturday, March 19, 2022.

#### What data do we store and why do we need it?

`user ids` - we store it for: blacklisting, moderation purposes, command usage, temporary usage stats.  
`guild ids` - we store it to make various bot features and the bot itself functional.  
`channel ids` - we store it to make logging (message edits/deletes, moderation actions etc.).  
`role ids` - we store it to make reaction roles, role on joins, mutes functional.  
`message ids` - we store it for moderation logging.  
`message jump urls` - we store it for: moderation logging, errors, edited messages logging.

#### Where do we store the data and who has access to it?

We use a json database to store the data itself. Only the Bot Developer (me) can access and modify the data at any given time.

#### Can I delete my data? What should I do if I have any concerns.

**(Future feature) Server's data** - once you kick the bot you'll be on a 30 (thirty) days grace period during which your server's data will not be deleted and you'll get to keep the data upon re-invite. Currently, all server data on a bot is deleted if you kick the bot.

If you have any concerns or want your all of your data deleted, you can contact me by adding me on Discord at Ryry013#9234. Keep in mind I cannot delete certain data, that includes:

- Moderation actions - we cannot delete this without one of the server administrator's request, although they also have a way to delete all the moderation data on a user using Rai commands without contacting me (type `;ml delete <user_id> -all`)
- Non-appealable blacklist - if you were blacklisted and can't appeal, unfortunately, that means the data will stay and you won't be unblacklisted ever.
- Server's grace period - we can actually delete this, but only by the server's owner request.

If you've mailed us, it can take up to 5 (five) work days until I gather and delete all of your data.
